Project Title: Solving the Navier Stokes Equations using the Finite Differencing and Finite Volume Methods

This repository contains a fully integrated codebase for solving the one-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations simplified under the assumptions of constant pressure, focusing on the balance between inertial, viscous, and external forces. The simplified equations for incompressible, constant-density flow are:

```math

\rho \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \rho u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \mu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + f

```
